A CYBERSECURITY HOME-LAB SETUP
This lab provides a controlled and safe environment for practicing security concepts and system monitoring.
The environment is built using VirtualBox for virtual machine management. At this stage, I have successfully deployed three core systems: two Windows 8 workstations and one Windows Server. The next phase involves integrating these systems into a single virtual network, replicating a basic office network setup to better understand system communication, access control, and network behavior.
